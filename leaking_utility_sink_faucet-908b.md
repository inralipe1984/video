Hereâ€™s how I approach fixing a leaking utility sink faucet:  

### 1. **Diagnose the Problem**  
The first step is identifying the source of the leak. Common causes include:  
- Worn-out washers or O-rings.  
- Damaged valve seats.  
- Corroded or cracked faucet components.  

### 2. **Turn Off the Water Supply**  
Before starting any repairs, I ensure the water supply is turned off to prevent accidents or further leaks.  

### 3. **Disassemble the Faucet**  
Using the right tools, I carefully take apart the faucet to inspect its internal components.  

### 4. **Replace Faulty Parts**  
Based on the diagnosis, I replace worn-out parts like washers, O-rings, or cartridges. If the faucet is severely damaged, I may recommend a full replacement.  

### 5. **Reassemble and Test**  
After replacing the necessary parts, I reassemble the faucet and test it to ensure the leak is fully resolved.  

## Tips for Preventing Future Leaks  

- **Regular Maintenance**: Check your faucet periodically for signs of wear and tear.
