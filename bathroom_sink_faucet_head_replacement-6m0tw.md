   Locate the shut-off valves under the sink and turn them clockwise to stop water flow.

   Turn the water supply back on and check for leaks. If necessary, adjust the faucet head or tighten it further.  

6. **Final Inspection**  
   Ensure the faucet head is secure and functions properly.  

## Tips for Choosing the Right Faucet Head  

- **Material**: Opt for corrosion-resistant materials like stainless steel or brass.
