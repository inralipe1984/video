## Step-by-Step Repair Process  

Hereâ€™s how I typically handle Moen single-handle kitchen faucet repairs:  

### 1. **Diagnose the Problem**  
The first step is identifying the issue. Common problems include:  
- **Leaking from the spout**: Often caused by a worn-out cartridge.  
- **Dripping from the handle**: Usually due to damaged O-rings or seals.  
- **Low water pressure**: May indicate a clogged aerator or internal debris.  

### 2. **Gather Necessary Tools and Parts**  
For most Moen faucet repairs, youâ€™ll need:  
- Adjustable wrench  
- Screwdriver (Phillips or flathead)  
- Replacement cartridge or seals (specific to your Moen model)  
- Plumberâ€™s grease  

### 3. **Turn Off the Water Supply**  
Locate the shut-off valves under the sink and turn them off to prevent water flow during the repair.  

### 4. **Remove the Handle and Access the Cartridge**  
- Use a screwdriver to remove the handle.  
- Carefully unscrew the retaining nut to access the cartridge.  

### 5. **Replace the Faulty Components**  
- Remove the old cartridge and replace it with a new one.  
- Inspect and replace any damaged O-rings or seals.  

### 6. **Reassemble the Faucet**  
Put everything back together in reverse order, ensuring all components are securely tightened.  

### 7. **Test the Faucet**  
Turn the water supply back on and test the faucet to ensure the issue is resolved.
