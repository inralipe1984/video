## Steps to Fix a Leaking Faucet  

As a professional plumber, I follow a systematic approach to ensure every repair is done right the first time. Hereâ€™s how I handle it:  

1. **Inspect the Faucet**: I start by identifying the type of faucet and the source of the leak. This helps me determine the necessary tools and parts.  
2. **Turn Off the Water Supply**: To avoid flooding, I shut off the water supply under the sink or at the main valve.  
3. **Disassemble the Faucet**: Using specialized tools, I carefully take apart the faucet to access the internal components.  
4. **Replace Worn-Out Parts**: Whether itâ€™s a washer, O-ring, or cartridge, I replace any damaged or worn-out parts.  
5. **Reassemble and Test**: After reassembling the faucet, I turn the water supply back on and test it to ensure the leak is fixed.  

## Tips for Homeowners  

Here are a few things you can do to maintain your faucet and prevent leaks:  
- Regularly clean your faucet to remove mineral buildup.  
- Avoid overtightening handles, as this can damage internal components.  
- Address leaks as soon as they appear to prevent further damage.
