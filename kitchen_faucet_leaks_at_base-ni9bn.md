## Why Kitchen Faucets Leak at the Base

Leaks at the base of a kitchen faucet often occur due to worn-out O-rings, loose connections, or corrosion within the fixture. Over time, the constant use of the faucet can cause these components to degrade, leading to water seepage. Additionally, improper installation or low-quality materials can accelerate the problem.

## Benefits of Fixing a Leaking Kitchen Faucet

Addressing a leaky kitchen faucet offers several advantages:
- **Water Conservation**: Fixing leaks reduces water waste, which is both environmentally friendly and cost-effective.
